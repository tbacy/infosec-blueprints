# infosec-blueprints

**infosec-blueprints** is an open-source knowledge base for practical, real-world information security.  
It offers templates, checklists, policies, and learning paths designed for individuals, small teams, and homelabbers.

This project exists to support learning — both mine and yours.  
It’s not a business. It’s not a brand. Just shared growth in the open.
